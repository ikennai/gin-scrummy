        <h3>About Fibonacci</h3>
        <p>The Fibonacci sequence appears in Indian mathematics in connection with Sanskrit prosody, as pointed out by Parmanand Singh in 1985.[8][10][11] In the Sanskrit poetic tradition, there was interest in enumerating all patterns of long (L) syllables of 2 units duration, juxtaposed with short (S) syllables of 1 unit duration. Counting the different patterns of successive L and S with a given total duration results in the Fibonacci numbers: the number of patterns of duration m units is Fm + 1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>
